Since a CSV dataset file was not provided in the task given,i created a sample CSV data of name and email. The pipeline which it follows, data from this CSV was read and inserted into a SQLite database. This demonstrates the complete CSV-to-database workflow in a simple way and as mentioned in task.

this folder has two modules
create_csv.py:- which manually creates a csv for the task
maain.py:-it reads from the csv and inserts into database sqlite
